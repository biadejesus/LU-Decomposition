<h2>High-level System Design </h2>
<p>The Berkeley UPC compiler project is seeking to
develop a fully-portable, high-performance UPC compiler that will run on a wide
variety of shared-memory and distributed-memory platforms using different
network interconnects, including large-scale multiprocessors, PC clusters, and
clusters of shared memory multiprocessors. One of the main goals of the project
is to experiment with parallel compiler optimization techniques, without being
tied to a particular system architecture or network. Portability is achieved by
translating UPC programs to an intermediate representation in C, which can then
be compiled using the system's ANSI C compiler and linked to a standardized
runtime system and communication system tailored to the specific platform.

    <td width="*">The figure shows the
      high-level system diagram for a UPC application compiled using the Berkeley
      UPC compiler. The generated C code runs on top of the UPC runtime system,
      which provides platform independence and implements language-specific
      features such as shared memory allocation and shared pointer manipulation.
      The runtime system implements remote operations by calling the GASNet
      communication interface, which provides hardware-independent lightweight
      networking primitives.&nbsp;</td>

<h2>The Berkeley UPC-to-C Translator</h2>
<p>The Berkeley UPC-to-C translator performs source to source translation from 
UPC code to ANSI-compliant C code, with shared memory operations transformed 
into calls to the Berkeley UPC runtime.&nbsp; The translator is based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open64">Open64</a> compiler suite; please refer 
to their documentation for information about the design and specific features of 
that compiler.&nbsp; Numerous modifications have been added to the translator to 
support UPC features, and the translator's C front end has also been extended to 
support both 32- and 64-bit platforms.&nbsp; A detailed description of our modifications
can be found <a href="https://upc.lbl.gov/publications/open64-talk.ppt">here</a>.</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" >
  <tr>
    <td width="*" >The figure gives a high-level overview of the 
    translation process.&nbsp; Upon receiving a preprocessed UPC program, the 
    translator invokes the UPC front end, whose function is to parse, 
    type-check, and generate the Whirl intermediate format for the program.&nbsp; 
    UPC-specific information such as shared types and block sizes of distributed 
    arrays are kept in the symbol table, so the translator could take advantage 
    of such information during optimizations.&nbsp; The back end operates on the 
    Whirl intermediate language and lowers shared memory operations into 
    equivalent runtime library calls.&nbsp; The Berkeley UPC runtime provides a 
    wide of variety of shared memory accesses from non-blocking to bulk, so that 
    the translator could experiment with different strategies for communication 
    optimizations such as message pipelining and prefetching.&nbsp; Finally the 
    whirl2c component translates Whirl into ANSI-compliant C code, with shared 
    variables declared as the opaque pointer-to-shared construct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

<h2>The Berkeley UPC Runtime</h2>
<p>The Berkeley UPC runtime specification documents the platform-independent interface
between compiler-generated C code and the UPC runtime system. It provides
platform-independent job/thread control, shared memory access (put/get
operations and bulk transfer operations), shared pointer manipulation and
arithmetic, shared memory management, UPC barriers and UPC locks. The shared
memory operations provide very flexible non-blocking shared memory access with a
wide range of synchronization alternatives. </p>
<p> In addition to providing platform independence, the Berkeley Runtime interface 
provides a cleanly-documented, compiler-independent "UPC abstract machine" 
that can be used as a compilation target by other front-end UPC compilers.</p>

<h2>The GASNet Networking Layer </h2>
<p><a href="https://gasnet.lbl.gov/">GASNet</a> is a language-independent, low-level networking layer that provides
network-independent high-performance communication primitives tailored for
implementing parallel global address space SPMD languages such as <b><a href="https://www.gwu.edu/~upc/">UPC</a></b>
and <a href="http://titanium.cs.berkeley.edu"><b>Titanium</b></a>. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%" >
  <tr>
    <td width="*" >The design of GASNet is partitioned into two layers
      to maximize porting ease without sacrificing performance: the lower level
      is a narrow but very general interface called the GASNet core API - the
      design is based heavily on Active Messages, and is implemented directly on
      top of each individual network architecture. The upper level is a wider
      and more expressive interface called the GASNet extended API, which
      provides high-level operations such as remote memory access and various
      collective operations.&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="221">

      <b>System diagram showing GASNet layers</b></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We've written a network-independent reference
implementation of the extended API purely in terms of the core API, which allows
GASNet (and the GAS compiler) to quickly and easily be ported to a new network
architecture by re-implementing only the minimal core API. GASNet is structured
such that implementers can choose to additionally bypass certain functions in
the reference implementation of the extended API and implement them directly on
the hardware to improve performance of specific operations when hardware support
is available (e.g. special network support for puts/gets or hardware-assisted
broadcast). </p>
