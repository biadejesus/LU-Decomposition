This directory contains a snapshot of the guts_main directory from
GUTS (GWU Unified Testing Suite) which has been *slightly* modified
to run under the Berkeley UPC test harness.  These modifications and
the associated harness.conf file were contributed by Gary Funck, who
summarized them as follows:

> The files were copied from
> the guts_main/src directory of the latest guts
> release along with the single file, gula.h, under
> the include directory.  The source files were updated
> to print a "Passed." message as appropiate and the
> GULA_FAIL macro was changed to prefix the error message
> with a prefix that includes the string "Error:", along
> with the source file/line where the error occurred.
> Other than that, everything is the same as the original.

The macro define BUPC_TEST_HARNESS is used to protect changes to the 
output behavior made to integrate cleanly into the Berkeley UPC test harness, 
as well as a few changes to avoid known bugs in the UPC compiler framework.

There have also been fixes applied to certain tests to correct bugs in 
the test code itself - eg. deviations from the UPC specfication or bugs that
obviously subvert the intended purpose of a test. This category of fix is
applied unconditionally, but we have made an effort to comment each 
non-obvious difference from GWU's code.

The README and CHANGELOG are unmodified copies of those files from the
top-level directory of GWU's GUTS distribution.
